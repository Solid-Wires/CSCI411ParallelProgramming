# CSCI 411 Project Lab Parallel Programming

Jared Whytsell

This assignment is simply changing the provided trapezoid definite integral calculator into a parallel program with different amounts of threads.

# How to run

Simply run make to create the executable. You should see bin and obj directories created in the workspace. Should you want the lecture examples that we discussed, run make lect_programs to see those.

bin/trap runs the program.
All of the lecture programs are located and ran at bin/lectures/.

# Analysis

TBD
